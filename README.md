# Amazon-Automation

# Introduction: 
# This Test Automation Framework is created using Java + Selenium Web Driver
# In this approach, the endeavor is to build a lot of applications independent reusable keyword components 
# so that they can directly used for another web application without spending any extra effort. With this framework in place,
# whenever we need to automate a web based application, we would not need to start from scratch, 
# but use the application independent keyword components to the extent possible and create application specific components for the specific needs.
